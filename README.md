# Project-Moriarty
We are building solutions to stop harrashment and hate speech in online voice communication
## OpenAI Whisper Hackathon

This project was build as project for openAI's Whisper hackathon. We intend to continue working on it in order to implement more useful features such as Real Time Speech Recognition, Multilinguality and more

##Whisper 
Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multi-task model that can perform multilingual speech recognition as well as speech translation and language identification.

A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. All of these tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing for a single model to replace many different stages of a traditional speech processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets.
